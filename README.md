# Event KeyCodes

https://thedanitor.github.io/event_keycodes/

This project is from the Day 11 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Good refresher on how to use template literals to dynamically replace content. 

### Things Learned

* The keydown event object has many different properties
* keyCode is deprecated (and VS code shows a line through it)
